Popish Priests,” and, after great suffering eud severity, he was
released, on asentence of banishment from the country. He peti·
tioned his superiore for permission to return to his beloved flock,
and painful labours, in the Colony, but his age and many infirmi·

magna eluxit abstinentia, solo pane et aqut saepe victitans, uec
his nisi sub. vesperem se reficiebat. Tam profunda hnmilitate
fuit, ιιι abjiciendi sese occasiones ultro quaerebat. Incommodo·

' licebat, pro sano se gerebat, ιιι ιιι inre simulator egregius.
Denique quaecumque egebat, sanctimoniam quamdam spirare
videbantur, utnon defuerint viri graves, qui asseruerint, si quen·
quam vidissent in hac vitu sanctum, eum procul dubio fuisse Pa·
· trem Andream Vitum.” .
