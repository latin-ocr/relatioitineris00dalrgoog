enim non obscura visuntur hodih indicia soli prius depressi, recen-
ter nati, et nondum ex integro formati.

. . . Two herbors . . . one of these . . . within these 200 years
since 1634, the force of the current has washed away certain por·
tions of the banks of the river. 'l'his is evident, lst, from note F,
page 104 3 and, from 00 examination of the place called Fort Point,
on an estate near Saint Inigoes‚ where Leonard Calwert had built
a fort, which was swallowod up, together with ten or twelwe of tho
very cannen he had placed there. But Father Joseph Carbery
drew ont seven, which were snnk in the snnd and covered by the
advancing tide, more than a hundred fathorns (or 200 yards) from
the shore, and which were easicr to reach, though one or two lay
'at about the depth of 20 feet. If in only one place the water
swallowed up so many fathoms of solid land, why could not the

same thing have happened around Herons’ Island nt Stflle'mentsl ¹

Why not around Piney Point, and along the charmel between the
present island of st. George and the whole shore, clear to Obori-y
Point—the shore being extended by deposita of earth brought down
from other places? Perhaps at this time the mouth of the Buy,
which the writer call St. Georges, could be entered directly from
Piney Point, and the above mentioned channel, now impassable sor
largeships,atthattimealfordedthemapassage. The fact that the
smallar Bay—the first ona to the left of Piney Point-still bears
the name of St. George, is in favor of this supposition, and also
the channel which is mentioned above. ¹

From this there is an entrance to tho larger Bay, which the
travellers also called St. George’s, but which has now changed i·s
name, being called St. lfnry'r, as well astho inner bey of St.
Mory’s towards the north and beyond the channcl of St. Ignatius.
Moreover, what if the present island of Sl. George was small at
thet time, having grown by deposits of mud and sand? For on
this island are seen to-day no doubtful proofs that the land was
formerly sunk [below the water ?]; that it has recently been
thrown up and is not yct completely formed.
