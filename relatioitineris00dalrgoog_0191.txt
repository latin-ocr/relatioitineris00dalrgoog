PREFACE.

Wflsu the Maryland Historical society, in J anuary, 1874. printed the
Relatio Itineris oi Father Andrew White, with the accompanying docu-
menta, in consequence of an imperfectiori in their manuscript copy, the
Latin textos the greater partos the Letters ol the decuit Missionaries
could not be given. The last thirty-nine peges oi Publication, No 7,

therefore, contain only the translation of the portion oi the Letters re-

ferred to above.
However, in December, 1875, the original MS. oi the Rev. Father

McSherry‚ was found amongst the Archives oi Loyola College, in this
Oity3 and it was, with the utmost promptness and courtesy, at once
offered by the Provincial of the S. J.. the Rev. Father Keller, to the
Society for transcription. From that MS. the following peges have been
careiuliy copied, and at the same tinae some corrections made in the text
oi the other parts of the Publication, from this original.

The figures in the text refer to the corresponding peges oi the transla-
tion3 e. g. (61.) means p'age 61 ol Publication, No 7, dac.

Α few N otes have been added, wherever it has been deemed judicious,
to call attention to some emendation of the text, or more accurate expres-
sion oi the meaning of the original.

The Editor is indebted to the pains and courtesy of a Reverend friend,
ior thirty years Missionary of the S. J . amongst the Odjibwa Indicas of
the N orth-West, for the interpretation, according to the language of that
people‚ of the Indian proper names, which occur in the Journal oi Father
White, and the Letters of the Missionaries. The Odjibwa language is a
close dialect oi the parent stock language‚ of which that spoken by the

Indians oi Maryland, Virginis and Eastern Pennsyivania was a member.
