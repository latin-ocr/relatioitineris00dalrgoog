When the next day dawned, we came to
another of the Caribbee Islands, which has
received the Spanish name of Guadalnpe from
the resemblance of its rough mountains, and it
is, Ι trust, under the guardianship of the same
Most Holy Virgin Mother. Thence we came to
Montserrat about noon‚ where πθ learned from
a French cutter, that πθ were not yet safe from
the Spaniards’ fleet. The inhabitants of Mont-
serrat arc lrishmen, who were banished by the
, English of Virginis, on account of their professing
the Catholio faith. Then we came to Maevius,
noted forits pestilential air and severs. After
spending one day, πθ sailed for St. Christopher’s
island, where πθ stayed ten days, having ra·
ceived a friendly invitation from the English
governor, and two Captains who were Catholics3
the President of the French Oolony in the same
island received me with especial courtesy.

All the rare things that are to be seen at
Barbadoes, I found atthis place too, and besides
thesea Substeroua· Mocntain, not far from the
Governor’s house. And what you would admira
more, the Viryin Pam, so called because at the

1 least touch of the finger, it immediately shrinks

and falls in; though, if you give it tima, it

revives and rises up again. I was especially
pleased with the Lacerat trec, which is supposed

to have afforded sustenance to st. John the
6 .
