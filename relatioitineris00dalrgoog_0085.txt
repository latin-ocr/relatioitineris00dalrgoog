tively considering the whole matter, and taking
the advice of men, distinguished for their experi-
ence and wisdom, he has now weighcd, with great
care, all the advantagcs, as well as disadvantages,
which have hitherto advanced or hindered other
colonies3 and found nothing which does not tend
strongly to confirm him in his design, aud promise
him the most prosperous success. For, both the
writings which his Most Noble wathes-v> has left
behind him-an eye-witnessffll reliable and worthy
of all credit-and tho constant reports of those
men who come to us every day from that country,
or places not far from it3 and besides, the very
faithful account‘N) written and published by Oap·
tain Smith, who first discovered the country—
what hc says of the fertility and excellence of its
soil is truly wonderful and almost incredible-add
to these also the unanimous agreement and testi·
mony of numbers of men, living here (in London)
who formerly came from those countries, . and
intend to return there, and who, with one voice,

verify and confirm what Smith has written.
