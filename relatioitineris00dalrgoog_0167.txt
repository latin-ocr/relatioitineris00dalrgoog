mentions, in the same place, that Georgo met with a harah re·
ception, not indeed from the governor 01 Virginia, <Sir John
Harvey, who was the first governor appointed by the King, and
by whom the company of merchants‚ which before ruled the
whole country, was broken up; and thus came more directly
under the control aud management of the King,) bnt from the
Assembly 01 110 Provinca

Γ11101010, as Georgo was a catholic, prohibited him from acquir·
ing property iu Virgiuia, aud 1001010 him to settle 11000, unless 10
would swear 10 recognize the spiritual supremacy 01 110 King 01
England, aud unless his catholic followers would 1101 themselves
hythe same 0011. Georgo refused, aud turned his attention to
wards exploriug the northern shore of the Potomac river and the
neighboring regions, to see whether he could not, hy good fortune,
liud some pleasant aud fertile 10010, 10 which he could conve·
niently lead his colonists, and establish there 0 settlcment for
CatholicS, where they would be undisturbed.

For, although 110 100010 01 1001, which were afterwards known
hythe name 01 Maryland, were formerly assigned 10 Virginis by
J ames the First, yet tho company of merchants‚ to whom he had
granted those 10010, 00 0 part of Virgiuia, having become extinct,
they had again, at length, fallen into the hands of the King, who
could 01 1101 tima, hestow them upon any one, according to his
own pleasure.

Itis not indeed certain, 00 Bozman says, from any testimony
of men, or historical recordo, thet George, 01100 10 1011 Virginia,
turned his course to the north aud sailed into the Chesapeeke Bay,
10 000 110 country, or its inhabitants. Yet, aman of his wisdom,
and cherishiug the design which he did, ought not to have omitted
this investigetiou. But, however 1101 may be, he had already
returned 10 England in the year 1631, and requested from charles
the First, that the district, which extends northwards from the
I'otomac, should be granted to him and his 10100.
