soled us for the bitter harshness of men. For we
understood that a Spanish fleet was stationed off
the island of Bonavista, to keep all foreigners ,
from engaging in the salt trade. Il, keeping to
our appointed route, we had gone on thither, wc*
should have fallen into the net, and become the
prey of our enemies. In the meantime, we were
delivered from a greater danger at Barbsdoes:
the servantsffil throughout the whole island had
conspired to hill their masters; then, indeed,
after having gained their liberty, it was their
intention to possess themselves of the first ship Ι
which should touch there, and venture to sea.
The conspiracy was diselosed by one who was
deterred by the atrocious eruelty of the enter·
prisc; and the punishment of one of the leaders
was sufficient for the security of the island and
our own safety. For our ship, as being the first
to touch thero, had been marked for their prey;
and on the very day we lauded, we found eight
hundred men in arms to oppose this wiched
design, which had just transpired.

The Island of Barbadoes is 30 miles in length
and 16 in breadth; it is 13 degrees from the equa· ¹
tor, and the climate is so warm, that the inhab-
itants in the winter months wear linen clothes and
bathe frequently. It was harvest time when we
arrived. It would be impossible to live there,
