the Editor, will be noticod any important variatione between the trane-

was printed in 1872, in the “Woodetock Lettere,” with a revision of

the translation of Dr. Brooks, for private circulation anrougst the mem-

The Editor takes thie occasion to return his thanks to tho Presidents
and Facultiee ol Georgetown and Loyola Colleges‚ for their ready assist-

McSherry-to William Lucas and John Murphy, Esqre.‚ for their kind
loan of valuable and rare publicatione, as the sources of the brief memoir
ot Father White, in the Appendix, and especially to the Rev. John S.
Sumner, S. J ., his ancient college mate and friend, for hie constant
interest and valuablo suggestions, ae the peges were passing through the
prees. E. A. D.
