.. Iliad boen ungrossed.. . .. Saint Paul, indeed, in
relating the favars granted him from heaven, speaks of himself as
of a third person. But why does the writer of this letter seem to
luy aside his modesty, in giving his own experienee? Perhaps it
was because he wished, in writing to his Superior, whether he was
the Provincial of England or the General Head of the Society, to
lay before him a full account of the state of his conscience. How·
ever that may be, it does not appear who that Father waS, by
whom this letter was written, nor to whom it was sent.

The Superiores the Marylaud Mission, it is likely, may hare
written it; but it is not established by any proof, as far as I know,
that Father Andrew White, (Vitus, as our annals call him iu

Broek, (his real name was John Murgan) presided orer· the
associates, though it seems to come nearer the truth to say that he
did not preside before the year· --; but that Father Andrew
did, and so it was proper that this letter should be written by him
to the Very Reverend Father Genera13 for it seems to be directed
tobim, since he calls the person to whom he writes by the title of
Your Paternily, as appears in this letter, page hl.
