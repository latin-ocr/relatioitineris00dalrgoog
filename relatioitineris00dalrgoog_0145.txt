might teach the contrary. But the reverse of
what was expected happened3 for our reasons

being heard, and the thing itself being more
⁸ clearly understood, they easily fell in with our
opinion, and the laity in like manner generally.

have recently corne to us from England, to our
great comfort, after an unpleasant voyage of
iourteen weeks, whereas it is not generally more

indeed that it will be abundant; thus far, we
may predict from their present zeal and the em-
ulation of their minds‚ since that is the most
certain sign oi the abiding of Him with ue, who
is the unit of the whole and the beginning of all
unity. ,
