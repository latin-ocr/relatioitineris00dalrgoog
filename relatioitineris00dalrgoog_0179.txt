Pege 35. The oppositiones (flaiborne ιο Lord Baltimore's (lol-
ony grew, aa is well known, out of his Lordship’s claim to Kent
Island, on which Olaiborne had established settlements. Gov-
ernor Oalvert had given·Olaiborne notice, during his visit to the
Governor of Virginia, on his wayto the Potomac‚ that he claimed
Kent Island as a part of his grant from thc Orown. On the llth

of March, 1634, only a few days after Galvcrt’s visit, tha Gov-
ernor and Oouucil of Virginia held a consultation, at the instance of
Oaptain William Olaiborne, on the subjectos Qalsert’s claim to
Kent Island and his demand that (llaiborna should consider himself
a member of his plantation, and relinquish all relation and depen·
dence upon the colony of Virginia. Ιι was deoided by the Board:
· “that whilst all good correspondence should be maintained with
Lord Baltimore’s colony, yet they knew no reason why they should
render up the rights of the Isle of Kent, more than of any other
place formerly given to tho Golony of Virginia by his Maiesty’s
Patent.”

over the conduct of William Pena, in pnrclrustoy his lands in
Pennsylvania from the Indians, it will be not amiss to bestowa

Baltimore's Governo'r. Hc purchased the land, upon which his
settlement was made, for what, ιο Indians, would be ample remu·
nerati0n‚ they being about moreorer to abendon their country, aa
indeed many of them had already done, in consequence of their
dread of the formidable Susqnehannocks.
