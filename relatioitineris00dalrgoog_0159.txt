As ior the rest, it is evident from a letter oi the Very Reverend
Father General, written on the 15th May, 1638, to Father Philip
Fisher, that this Father was the Superior of the Assoeiates in '
Maryland. Accordingly, Ι suppose that Father Andrew Whito,
after governing three years, was relieved ol tho horden, and that
his successor, Father Philip Pisher‚ directed the mission for only
three years3 and Father John Broek was put in his place, as
appears from a letter written to him hy the Very Reverend
Fathei General, on the loth of September, 1610.

Hence, we have clearly indicated the probable suceession of
Superiors of Maryland: hirst, Father Andrew White, in the year
1634; second, Father Philip Fisher, lo3i; third, Father John
Brock, 16403 fourth,
