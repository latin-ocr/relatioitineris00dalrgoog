us, he was carried off by the common sickness
prevailing in the Colony, from which no one ol
the three remaining Priests has escaped unharmed3
yet we have not ceascd to labor, to the best of
our ability among the neighboring peoplelcl

And though the rulers of this Colony have not
yet allowed us to dwell among the savages‚ both
on account of the prevailing sickness, and also,
because of the hostile disposition which the barba-
rians evince towards the English, they having slain
a man from this Colony, who was'staying among
them for the sake of trading, and having also
entered into a conspiracy against our whole nation;
yet we hope that one of us will shortly secure a
station among the barbarians. Meanwhile, we
devote ourselves more nealously to the English3
'and since there are Protestants as well as Cath-
olics in the Oolony, we have labored for both,
and God has blessed our labore.
