they meet a toacher clearly explaining these
things, they show themselves very attentive as
well as docile; and by and by are seriously turned
to think of their souls; so as to be ready to ob-
tain those things which, they perceive, conduco
to the salvation of the same. They are readily
swayed by reason, nor do thoy withhold their
assent obstinately from the truth set forth ina

· credible manner. This natural disposition· of the

tribe, aided by the seasonablo assistance of divine
grace, gives us hope of the most desirable harvest

hereafter, and animatas us to continue our labors

' in this vineyard with the greatest exertion. And

the same ought to be an incitement to all those
who in future, by the will of God, may come
hitherto us for supply or assistance.

To the hope of the Indian harvest, arc to be

added also no mean fruits reaped from the colony
l and its inhabitants, to whom, on the principal
festival days of the year, sermons are preache'd,
and the catechetical expositions given on the
Lord’s day. Not· only catholics come in erowds,
but also very many heretics—-not without the
reward of our labors3 for this year, twelve in
all, wearied of former errorS, have returned to
favor with God and the ehurchv. Our people
cesse not daily to engage in their divine employ-

ment, and to dispenso the sacraments to those ,

that come, as often as circumstances demand.
