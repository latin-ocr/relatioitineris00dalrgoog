cod-fish are caught all the year round3 but the
most convenient time to catch them is in the
eolder menthe, ior the warm weather interferes
with salting them. Now this great abundanee of

fish arises from the following cause: the wind,
which uniformly hlows from the Canariae to the

north-east, drives the water of the ocean, and, with
it, the fish into the Gulf of Mexico; from which,
since there is no escape for it either to the east or
the south, itis driven with great force towards the
north, and carries with it large numbers of fish '
along the shores of Florida, Virginia, Maryland‚
and New England. These, fiying from the larger
fish, take refuge in shallow places, where they are
more easily caught by the fishermen.

There are various notable rivere. The chief of
these they call the Attomech, (Potomac,) a naviga·
ble river running eastward 140 milae, where there
is such a lucrative trade with the Indians, that a
certain merchant in the last year, exported heaver
skins to the value of 40‚000 gold areuna, and the
profit of the traffic is estimated at thirty feld.

On the plains and in the open fields there is a
great abundanee of grass; but the country ie, for
the most part, thichly wooded. There are agraet
many hickory treeS, and the oaks are so straight

and tall, that beams, sinty ieet long and 2t feet ·
