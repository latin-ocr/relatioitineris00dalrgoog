. . . wne uarrowest. . . . At the present time also, as is seen to·
day, this crossing is shorter than any other in the whole course
of the river. Itis easy, then, to infer srom this, that the ficet
sailed to the island in question, but not to St. George's Island or
elsewhere; forthere is no other narrower crossing place anywhere
on the river.

In addition to this, tha island was niue leagues (or twenty-

' seven miles) from the mouth of the river, which is now called St.

Mury⁷s‚ as will appear in this letter, page 36. Now, indeed, this
is tha exact distance between Herons' Ialand aud the mouth of
St. Mary’s River ar hay, which the pilgrims theu called St.
George's. Moreover, St. George’s Island, which goes by the
same name today, is situated just at the mouth of the river, and
from the western extremity of this island, by making a circuit of
only three miles, you can enter the main stream of the river.
