NOTES.

Page 114 of F. Puunrcnrrow, No. i: N ote 28, p. 51, is incom-
plete: there should be added the following:

At Georgio non licuit perbreve commorationis tempus in Vir· ,
ginis A. D. 1628, res propriis oculis videre, sed solum andita·
colligere.

Voluit euim dux itineris, coloniae qnam in Marylandiam dedu·
cere cogitabat, programma vel prospectum proponere, quo regio·
nem describebat ex diversis peregrinorum relationibus, ut colonos
invitaret et alliceret ad experimentum tentandum. Fides, igitur,
narrationi adhibenda, est penes testes ex auditu, rel sorte, si ex
visu, res modo peregrinatorum amplificavere.

But George on account oi the briei duration of his stay in
Virginis, in the year of our Lord 1628, could not have seen
things with his own eyeS, but could only have collected the

¹ Reports of others.

For the leader of the expedition chose to set fort-h to the
Oolony which he intended to lead to Maryland,a manifesto or
prospectus in which he described the country according to the
various accounts of strangers, in order to invite and attract
colonists to try the experiment. The credit to be reposed in the
recital, therefore, must be such as is given to witnesses by hear-
say, or if they were eye-witnesses, they exaggerated things aiter
the fashion of travellers.
