ours3 moreover they appeared to be about three
leagues (nine miles) off, towards tho west, and
to be trying to come up with us, now ancl then,
also, they would send messengers to ancl tro and
communicate with each other. As wc suspected
that they were Turhish pirates, we rnade all the
necessary preparations for fighting. And there
were some among our men, who inconsiderately

whether ho could give a plausible reason for
fighting, and indeod Ι think the contest would
have been an arduous one, though, perhaps they
fearcd us as much as we did thom3 and they
were, as I conjecture, merchants who wore on
'their way to the Fortunate lslanrls, not far

distant, and either could not overtahc uS, or
did not wish to.
