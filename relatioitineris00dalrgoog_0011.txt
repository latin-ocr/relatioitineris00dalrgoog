PREFAOE.

Arous the year 1832, the Rev. William MeSherry, S. J ., discovered
in the archives of the “Domus Prosesaa'’ oi the Society in Rome, the
originals of the MSS. which are named on the title page. He oarefully
copied these MSS. and placed the copies in the Library of Georgetovvn
College, D. 0., oi which institution (being at the same time Provincia]
of the society in Maryland) he afterwards became the honored Presi-
dent. In the year 1844, through the kind agency of the Rev. Charles J.
White, D. D., the Faculty of Georgetown College presented to the Mary-
land Historical Society, ahandsome copy of Father MoSherry's tran-

scripts of the Roman MSS. A very excellent translation was made from
this copy in the year 1847, by Nathan 0. Brooks‚ L. L. D., a member of
Ἴ the Maryland Historical Society. Several copies of the translation were

printed, and subsequently, it was published in “Peter norece collection
of Historical Traots,'⁷ vol. iv, No. 12.

The translation of Dr. Brooks having become exoeedingly rare, the
Maryland Historical Society resolved to print, not only, a new transla-
tion of the MSS, but also to accompany it with the Latin Text. But it
was then discovered that the MSS. had unaccountably disappeared from
the urchives of the Society; and all efforts to reoover the volume, or even
’ to trsce it, were unavailing. Application was therefore nrade to the
Faculty of Georgetown College for permission to make a second copy
from the MS. in their Library. After rnuoh delay in searching ior it,
it was ascertained that Father MoSherry’s MS. was no longer in the
Library of Georgetown College, but in that of Loyola College, in Baiti-
more. Through the kind offiees of Mr. John Murphy, the Faculty of
Loyola College very promptly loaned to the Maryland Historical Society
the MS. in their Library. This was careiully copied, and afterwards
oollated with 'much pains; and it is now printed verbatim, literatius, et
punctuatim. In several respeets, (but few of them however of any im-
portanoe,) it differs, in orthography, punctuation, use of capital letters,
dee, from the copy from which was made the former copy of the Maryland
Historical Society, and which was translated by Doctor Brooks. The
text moreover ends very abruptly on page 61 of this publication3 where-
as, in the former copy, it included tho entire Latin original of the last
