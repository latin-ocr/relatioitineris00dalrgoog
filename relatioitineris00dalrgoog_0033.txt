When we arrived at this bay, we had sailed
three thousand ltalian miles under full sail,

single bour, about mid-day. ’

Ι cannot easily discover the cause of aucha

constant wind, unless, perchance, one should say
it arises from the sun’s being so near, as it
passes between the tropics, and from the fact
that it draws from the sea, by the power ol its
heat, two kinds ol vapor, tho one dry from the
saltness of the sea, the other rnoist by reason of
the water: the wind proceeds from the former,
and from the latter are produced the rains; and
