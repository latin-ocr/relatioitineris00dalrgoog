disoourse at the time, he promised that he would
return before very long. “That is just what I

where all the inhabitants flew to arms. About five
hundred, equipped with bows, had stationed them-
selves on the shore with their. Emperor. But after
signals of peaoe were made, the Emperor, laying
aside all apprehension‚ earne on board the pinnam,
and when he heard of our friendly disposition
towards those nations, he gave us permission to
dwell wherever we pleased in his dominions.
